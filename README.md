# doineedavisa
A second project in Python. Web application for checking visa requirements.

It's a small web application that allows the user to check whether she or he requires the visa to travel to a particular country. 

Such applications exist already thus I do not to aim to make it better. As my Calculator exercise it bears educational purpose.
